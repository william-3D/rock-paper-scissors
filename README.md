# rock-paper-scissors
A simple implementation of the grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. An unguided project recommended by The Odin Project.

Icons for the rock, paper & scissors buttons were self-drawn in Procreate.

Bugs to fix:
- score for each player does not go up past 1
- when Restart button is clicked, Your Choice shows as "restart"
